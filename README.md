# Petful

This project was created for Thinkful, utilizing their pre-existing templates to make a very, very simple 'adopting' application.

 
 The live app is deployed here: https://petful-client-q53gefknl.vercel.app/
 
 The server is deployed here: https://petful-api-server.herokuapp.com/

## Summary

 Petful allows you to barely simulate the adoption process utilizing a Queue system on the Express server. 
 
 The user is placed in a rotating Queue, and when it is their turn to adopt they are allowed to adopt either a cat or a dog, whichever one was first placed in the queue. Clicking the adopt button will adopt the animal.
 
 
 ## Tech stack
 
 The front-end was completed with React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and vanilla CSS. 
 
 On the backend I used Express to write the server and endpoints.
